When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    I want to use a remote repository when I work with someone else or when
    I want to share my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to share my work only when it was ready or I finished the
    required feature.
