When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    I want to use a remote repository when I work with someone else or when
    I want to share my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to share my work only when it was ready or I finished the
    required feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks only exists in the context of GitHub and it is like a clone in their
    repositories. Clone is when you copy a repository from one place to another
    to work with and branches are differents works on one repository.
    I will use fork to make changes to a existing repository and share my work
    so it will be integrated into the original repository o accesible to 
    anyone. I will use clone to work with a repository and I use branches when
    I want to work on a different feature of the project I'm working on.
