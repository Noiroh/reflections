What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It prepares the directory for being tracked by git. I need to ensure that
    the needed files for git are created propertly and I'm telling git to track
    this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Is a temporal area where I add the files that I will commit, so it gives me
    the vision of what will be the next changes to commit.
