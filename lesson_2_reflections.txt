What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It prepares the directory for being tracked by git. I need to ensure that
    the needed files for git are created propertly and I'm telling git to track
    this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Is a temporal area where I add the files that I will commit, so it gives me
    the vision of what will be the next changes to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    Using "git diff" to add only those changes of that logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    When working on two differents features at the same time or several persons.
    In that case, the branches keep all the work organized.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    The diagrams help to get a global vision of the state of all the branches
    and commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    The result is to join the work of either two branches in one commit. We
    represent this that way because the result commit has the two parents that
    correspond to the last commit in each branches merged.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    The main pros is that it will be more qickly. The cons is that the changes
    are similar, we could want to unify the new funcionality.
